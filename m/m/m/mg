# Develop a sentinel-controlled-repetition script that 
# prompts the user to input the miles driven and gallons used for each tankful. 
# The script should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each tankful.
#  After processing all input information, the script should calculate and display the combined 
# miles per gallon obtained for all tankfuls (that is, total miles driven divided by total gallons used).
